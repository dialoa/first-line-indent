\noindent This document illustrates first-line indent typesetting. In
English typography, paragraphs just below a section heading aren't
indented, because a heading is enough to separate them from what is
before. The same should apply to the first paragraph of a document with
a title---so this paragraph is not indented.

This paragraph is indented. But after this quote:

\begin{quote}
\noindent Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
\end{quote}

\noindent the paragraph continues, so there should not be a first-line
indent.

We want this quote to end a paragraph:

\begin{quote}
\noindent Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
\end{quote}

\indent The text below therefore begins a new paragraph and should have
a first-line indent. We have to manually specify using
\texttt{\textbackslash{}indent}.

\hypertarget{basic-tests}{%
\section{Basic tests}\label{basic-tests}}

After a heading (in English typographic style) the paragraph does not
have a first-line indent.

\hypertarget{manually-specifying-indentation-on-certain-paragraphs}{%
\subsection{Manually specifying indentation on certain
paragraphs}\label{manually-specifying-indentation-on-certain-paragraphs}}

In the couple of paragraphs that follow the quotes below, we have
manually specified \texttt{\textbackslash{}noindent} and
\texttt{\textbackslash{}indent} respectively. This is to check that the
filter doesn't add its own commands to those.

\begin{quote}
\noindent Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
\end{quote}

\indent Here we've explicitly required a first line indent.

\noindent Here we've explicitly required \emph{not} to have one.

\hypertarget{automatic-removal-of-first-line-indentation}{%
\subsection{Automatic removal of first line
indentation}\label{automatic-removal-of-first-line-indentation}}

We can also check that indent is removed after lists:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A bullet
\item
  list
\end{itemize}

\noindent And after code blocks:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{local} \VariableTok{variable} \OperatorTok{=} \StringTok{"value"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\noindent Or horizontal rules.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\noindent We check that this behavour is overriden for specified
classes. We created a custom class to preserve indentation after certain
elements:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{This code block }
\NormalTok{should be followed }
\NormalTok{by an indented }
\NormalTok{paragraph}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And another one to remove indents after others:

This paragraph's Div container should not be followed by indentation,

\noindent as specified in this document's options.

\hypertarget{further-tests}{%
\section{Further tests}\label{further-tests}}

In this document we added a few custom filter options.

\hypertarget{size}{%
\subsection{Size}\label{size}}

The size of first-line indents is 2em instead of the default 1.5em
(Pandoc) or 1em (Quarto).

\hypertarget{indent-within-quotes}{%
\subsection{Indent within quotes}\label{indent-within-quotes}}

Blockquotes first-line indentation:

\begin{quote}
\noindent Blockquotes should not be indented on their first paragraph
but otherwise have the same size of ident as the main text.

Hence this second paragraph has a first-line indentation of 2em.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{keep-or-remove-indentation-after-certain-types-of-elements}{%
\subsection{Keep or remove indentation after certain types of
elements}\label{keep-or-remove-indentation-after-certain-types-of-elements}}

We also added an option to automatically remove indent after tables:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}rlcl@{}}
\caption{Demonstration of simple table syntax.}\tabularnewline
\toprule\noalign{}
Right & Left & Center & Default \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endfirsthead
\toprule\noalign{}
Right & Left & Center & Default \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
12 & 12 & 12 & 12 \\
123 & 123 & 123 & 123 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\end{longtable}

\noindent So this paragraph's first line is not indented. We added the
option \emph{not} to remove ident after ordered lists and definition
lists:

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Definition]
This is a definition block.
\end{description}

So this paragraph is indented.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  An ordered
\item
  list
\end{enumerate}

And this one is too.

\hypertarget{recursion-and-nesting}{%
\subsection{Recursion and nesting}\label{recursion-and-nesting}}

The paragraphs below are nested within a Div element---actually, two
nested Divs, in order to check that the filter is applied recursively
within Divs.

\hypertarget{div}{}
\leavevmode\vadjust pre{\hypertarget{subdiv}{}}%
The first paragraph within a Div is indented normally, but the list
below

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  list item
\item
  list item
\end{itemize}

\noindent should not be followed by a indented paragraph.

The last paragraph within Divs should be indented normally.

The filter is also applied recursively within blockquotes. A
blockquote's first paragraph shouldn't be indented, but any subsequent
ones should. Within the block quotes, indents should be removed after
special blocks, as in the main text.

\begin{quote}
\noindent The first paragraph of this blockquote does not have a first
line indent.

The subsequent paragraph has one. It's followed:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  by a
\item
  list
\end{itemize}

\noindent after which there is no first line indentation.

This next paragraph is first line indented again..
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{list-content}{%
\subsection{List content}\label{list-content}}

Within lists, paragraphs should be separated by vertical whitespace.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  This list item contains multiple paragraphs.

  The second one should not be indented, but separated by vertical
  whitespace.
\end{itemize}
